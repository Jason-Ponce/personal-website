                    The project was intended to showcase a famous figure in history. The cover was done in representation
                    of the two ruler Emperor justinian and Empress theodora. Important to note that the correct name of Byzantium was 
                    Eastern Roman Empire as they still considered themselves Roman.

                <p>
                    The pamphlet consisted of 8 pages, a front, back, and 6 content pages. One of the lessons learned from designing a pamphlet is the design and layout
                    can be applied to web page creation.

                    Even simple pen and paper planning goes a long way in figuring out how the basic design of any project. An overarching style can be created
                    and applied to each page that unifies the whole experience.

                    This pamphlet was created on InDesign. If you were in a rush a small 8 page pamphlet could easily be done without working knowing any 
                    of the advanced features InDesign has to offer. Thankfully learning how to use the master pages and applying styles makes the whole project a 
                    dynamic work instead of a static word page.

                    Learning how to create documents, such as pamphlets is a perfect way to begin learning web designing. Much like how one could read the newspaper
                    and learn techniques on how to design as website.

                    Back to creating a pamphlet for the Eastern Roman Empire. Careful thought was needed to select the correct font, font color, the background color, images
                    and design. For example, black text would've worked on the text blocks of the pamphlet. But it's not easy on the eyes.

                    The map used here is also a free to use image. The last thing that a product needs is for legal action for using material that wasn't licensed. Which is another
                    important step to take when developing a website. Don't do evil.

                    And this is the last page. The front and back page was entirely designed by me and i'm just a big fan of it, minus the eagle symbol which is under creative commons and the font.

                <div class="divider divider-increase"></div>
                <p>
                    The logo in the top right was created first and altered to be made part of in a series of stationary objects. This image was showcasing the overall style of the documents
                    I would be creating and application of text and font to simulate actual usage of my design. 
                </p>

                <div class="divider divider-increase"></div>
                <p>
                    The next stationary object I made was a letter head. Again the logo is incorporated.
                </p>

                <div class="divider divider-increase"></div>
                <p>
                    If you haven't caught on yet, the logo is representative of a socket. My creative front cover of the business card shows an example of how it would look like.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="stationary-4">
                <h5>Business Card-Back</h5>
                <div class="divider divider-increase"></div>
                <p>
                    Nothing special, just a flipped image of the front.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="stationary-5">
                <h5>Logo-Original</h5>
                <div class="divider divider-increase"></div>
                <p>
                    Before all the stationary was designed, the logo for the company was made. This was made in Illustrator. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="stationary-6">
                <h5>Logo-Altered</h5>
                <div class="divider divider-increase"></div>
                <p>
                    One of the more important things I learned from making this, was to make images that will scale. If you take a look at the original logo and the altered logos on the 
                    stationary objects. The fine details lines on the border goes missing and it looks more like a solid line than multiple lines.

                    I was at <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" class="link-black">fonts.google</a> looking at fonts and with the "&ltJ/P&gt" as the sentence preview. The original font I had found
                    similar to what the logo used to be. Doing some crazy Illustrator magic I transformed it to this.
