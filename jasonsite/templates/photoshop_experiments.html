                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 col s12">
                The smduge effect was the first experiment into Photoshop that I did. What was recommended was a bright photo so that when the 
                smudge was applied, the smudge wouldn't just be a mess of grey goop. For the before pictures, I choose to use a group of flowers
                right outside Buley Library. Possibly with more colors, the end result would've been much more pleasing.

            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 col s12">
                The underwater effect was a multistep process that required layers, text placement and manipulation, and color adjustment.
                One step that I was not able to follow through with is the bubbles that were added to the middleground. I would recommend
                to download the media provided in the lesson and following their steps before trying with another image.

                   Looking at the explosion effect tutorial that adobe provides always looks better than what you achieve. Here in my picture I tried to apply
                   the explosion effect on my dog. It was my attempt to enhance the speed he was going with the explosion following the path of travel. Next time, 
                   I would use another image as the source of the explosion to provide more color and variation to the mess that is the 3D explosion effect in this picture.
